        "\n",
        "- *Average Time Complexity*: The average time complexity for accessing an element in a dictionary is O(1). This means that, on average, retrieving a value using its key does not depend on the number of elements in the dictionary. This efficiency arises from the use of hash functions that map keys to specific locations in the underlying array structure, allowing for direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Worst Time Complexity*: In the worst-case scenario, the time complexity can degrade to O(n). This situation typically occurs due to hash collisions, where multiple keys hash to the same index in the array. When this happens, the dictionary must resolve these collisions, often by linking entries at the same index or open finding another open slot. As a result, if many keys collide, accessing an element may require traversing a list of entries at that index, leading to linear time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Key Size Impact*: The time complexity can also vary based on the size and type of the key. For example, while accessing integer keys is generally O(1) due to their constant size and straightforward hashing, string keys may introduce additional overhead. The time complexity for string key access can be O(k), where k is the length of the string. This is because hashing and equality checks for strings involve examining each character. Thus, while integer key access remains constant time on average, string key access may be influenced by its length.\n",
